Next Steps
View Your App: Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see your application running.

Continue Development: You can now start building out the features, logic, and styling for your components (HeroSection, Footer, BookingForm, etc.). The development server will automatically reload when you save changes.

Address Warnings (Optional): You can safely ignore the DeprecationWarning messages for now, as they don't affect functionality. They are part of the react-scripts package configuration.


Next Steps
Since both components are running and communicating (based on our previous troubleshooting), you can now focus on testing the core functionalities:

Test the Login/Authentication: Ensure you can successfully log in and that the JWT is saved to localStorage.

Test the API Call: Navigate to the page that loads the service requests (e.g., your MyServiceRequests component) to verify that the React component successfully fetches data from the Express API using the JWT in the Authorization header.

The DeprecationWarning messages are just informational warnings from Webpack and can be safely ignored for now, as they do not prevent your application from running. Happy coding!
